###Overview of Project
PyBer CEO has given you and your manager a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

       Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
      Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
      Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis README.md.
      
      ## Results 
             Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

             The Suburban fares started around $1,000, and the analysis was not profitable, fare dropped in March and in mid-April.
             The Rural fares started at around $200, the analysis shows fares increase and dropped till the end of April.
             The Urban fares start with an average of $1,800 with a consistent increase around 2,300.
